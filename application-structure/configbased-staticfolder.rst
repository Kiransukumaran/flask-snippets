Config-based static_folder
==========================

A response to `a question on the mailing-list`_: how replace the
`static_folder parameter`_ by a config value?


::

    import flask
    class MyFlask(flask.Flask):
        @property
        def static_folder(self):
            if self.config.get('STATIC_FOLDER') is not None:
                return os.path.join(self.root_path, 
                    self.config.get('STATIC_FOLDER'))
        @static_folder.setter
        def static_folder(self, value):
            self.config.get('STATIC_FOLDER') = value
    
    # Now these are equivalent:
    app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='foo')
    
    app = MyFlask(__name__)
    app.config['STATIC_FOLDER'] = 'foo'


However since the URL rule is still created in __init__ this only work
for setting a different path, not for disabling it completely with
None.


::

    # Still no static URL rule, /static/foo.png gives HTTP 404
    app = MyFlask(__name__, static_folder=None)
    app.config['STATIC_FOLDER'] = 'foo'
    
    # /static/foo.png gives HTTP 500 rather than 404:
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['STATIC_FOLDER'] = None

Generating Feeds with Flask
===========================

Atom is an easy way to let other people subscribe to changes on your
website. For example people can subscribe to the recent additions of
content on your website.

Assuming you already have a way to access that information (database
query for most recent blog posts for example) generating an Atom feed
is easy as pie.

All you need is the `AtomFeed` class from the Werkzeug contrib package
(this is there for you in any Flask application). Just create a view
function like this:


::

    from urlparse import urljoin
    from flask import request
    from werkzeug.contrib.atom import AtomFeed
    
    
    def make_external(url):
        return urljoin(request.url_root, url)
    
    
    @app.route('/recent.atom')
    def recent_feed():
        feed = AtomFeed('Recent Articles',
                        feed_url=request.url, url=request.url_root)
        articles = Article.query.order_by(Article.pub_date.desc()) \
                          .limit(15).all()
        for article in articles:
            feed.add(article.title, unicode(article.rendered_text),
                     content_type='html',
                     author=article.author.name,
                     url=make_external(article.url),
                     updated=article.last_update,
                     published=article.published)
        return feed.get_response()


Some things to keep in mind: `published` is optional, `updated` is
not. A feed should not contain all items but only the most recent ones
and it should be ordered by date. Also the URLs should be external, to
ensure that you can use `urlparse.urljoin` with the current request's
root URL as first argument and the one to externalize as second.

Extra attention: if the content (rendered_text) is marked as `Markup`
you will have to convert it to standard `unicode`. The snippet above
does that in any situation, because it cannot do any harm.

To tell browsers about a feed on a page, you can embed the following
code in the `<head>` section of your site:


::

    <link href="{{ url_for('recent_feed') }}"
          rel="alternate"
          title="Recent Changes" 
          type="application/atom+xml">
